To get an idea of the importance of what Tomasetti & Vogelstein (henceforth T&V) missed in their paper (and how important oversights may have been), I have compared the tissue types in recent CRUK cancer stats against those used in their paper, as the first of a few analyses. Source code (primarily within Rmarkdown documents), data *etc.* are available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/lmmx/tomasetti-vogelstein-2015).
