Analysis of Tomasetti & Vogelstein (2015)
=========================================

To get an idea of the importance of what Tomasetti & Vogelstein (henceforth T&V) missed in their paper (and how important oversights may have been), I have compared the tissue types in recent CRUK cancer stats against those used in their paper, as the first of a few analyses. Source code (primarily within Rmarkdown documents), data *etc.* are available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/lmmx/tomasetti-vogelstein-2015).

Prevalence of cancer types surveyed
-----------------------------------

CRUK's prevalence statistics by cancer site are the most recent data put out (yes, T&V used U.S. figures but that seems irrelevant).

> There are more than 200 different types of cancer, but four of them - breast, lung, prostate, and bowel - account for over half (53%) of all new cases in the UK (2011). <small>[Cancer Research UK, *CancerStats: 'Cancer incidence for common cancers'*](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerstats/incidence/commoncancers/uk-cancer-incidence-statistics-for-common-cancers#Twenty)</small>

> The scientists note that some cancers, such as breast and prostate cancer, were not included in the report because of their inability to find reliable stem cell division rates in the scientific literature. They hope that other scientists will help refine their statistical model by finding more precise stem cell division rates. <small>[John Hopkins press release, '*Bad Luck of Random Mutations Plays Predominant Role in Cancer, Study Shows*'](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/bad_luck_of_random_mutations_plays_predominant_role_in_cancer_study_shows)</small>
